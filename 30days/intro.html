        <h2>30 Days of Learning</h2>
        <p>This project was started with the aim of dedicating at least 30 minutes a day to learning ~new~ things for one month. I chose 30 minutes because it’s a very manageable amount of time - giving me the option to exceed it (which I hope to do as much as possible), but also not eating up too much of my time if I’m deep into a personal project. I also want to make sure to allot some time to writing some notes and a summary of what I completed.</p>
        <p>Obviously so much can be said about *learning* - web development really is a continuous learning process, and working on (or expanding) any project always results in new problems with new solutions to be found. For the purpose of this project “learning new things” means trying out new, unfamiliar frameworks/libraries/features/etc., (i.e. beyond the MEAN Stack).</p>
        <p> I’m hoping to do some tutorials, and maybe try out some new ideas on my own (but if it ends up being 30 days of purely tutorials, then that's cool too). I’m planning to base each day around a small project, rather than general instructional courses (à la Codecademy) - though I likely will be doing such courses, just not keeping track of them here.        </p>
        <p>I don’t want to spread myself too thin - I'm not planning on trying out something completely new every single day. I’m not aiming to master every skill - far from it, really - my goal is to try these things out, and see what I find most useful/interesting, and pursue those skills further. I want to have something to show for each day - whether it’s an update or new feature on a past day’s project, or something entirely from scratch. I want to *see* results and learn by doing/trying/building. </p>
        
        <p>My personal guidelines/standards for this challenge are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Don’t learn about same tool/framework/library/etc. two days in a row.</li>
            <li>Post a picture or link to each day's end product.</li>
            <li>Write something every day - it doesn't have to be long or in depth, notes and a summary are better than nothing.</li>
            <li>If I do a tutorial, I'll post a link.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So, without further ado, please checkout the links below to see what I've learned so far.</p>
