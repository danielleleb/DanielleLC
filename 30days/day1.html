            <!-- <p class="blog-date"></p> -->
            <!-- <p>First off, please forgive my bizarre choice of background for this post - but there's a reason behind it. My first experience in seeing the possibilities of Canvas was watching a wise web developer create a spiral (inspired by the shell of a snail). A background-worthy snail image was difficult to find - but seemed appropriate. </p> -->
            <p>My curiosity regarding Canvas has been growning more and more. I‚Äôll admit, I was initially scared away from it based on stories I‚Äôd heard about how difficult and frustrating it was (though really, if studying web development has taught me anything, it‚Äôs how to come to terms with my frustrations). After seeing some of the impressive things that Canvas can do, and hoping to eventually create a Canvas-based game (add that to my todo list) while hopefully incorporating something a bit more ~visually enticing~ into my skillset, I decided to take the plunge and try out a tutorial. </p>
            <p>Today‚Äôs tutorial consisted of the first two videos in Chris Courses‚Äô YouTube Playlist <a class="challenge-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6OkltgudE&list=PLpPnRKq7eNW3We9VdCfx9fprhqXHwTPXL">‚ÄúHTML5 Canvas Tutorials for Beginners | Become a Canvas Pro‚Äù</a>. Despite the title, I‚Äôm not hoping or expecting to become a pro, just looking to dabble in some neat animations. I chose this video series because (a) it had great comments/reviews, (b) it‚Äôs recent - last updated in February 2018, and (c) the series is broken down into 8 videos all under 40 minutes (perfect for the purpose of this tutorial challenge). </p>
            <p>These first two videos covered creating the Canvas element, drawing rectangles, lines and circles and randomizing the position of elements. The second video left off with a challenge of randomizing the circles‚Äô colours - this was a nice challenge of independent thinking. Randomizing the size of the circles based on the length of the radius, and factoring in the size of the viewport when randomizing the x and y positions were things I hadn‚Äôt considered before. I always find expressions using Math.random() to obtain values within the desired range interesting (and usually also tricky to wrap my head around).</p>        
            <p>In terms of today‚Äôs end result, so far, nothing too exciting. Some lines, some circles, some randomized colours and sizes, but I like where it‚Äôs going. Next up is adding some movement and interactivity - soon I will be drawing snail shells and spirals as if it's my second nature üòé. Fair warning to anyone who might take a peak at the Codepen below - my results from this tutorial are not dissimilar to the scribbles of an uncontrollable child you‚Äôd find in the back of a colouring book. Enjoy!!</p>
