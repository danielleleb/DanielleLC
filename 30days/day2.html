            <p>This tutorial was my first *real* foray into learning React. I say “real” because technically this was my second attempt. I don’t really count my first try, as I got VERY sidetracked after step one, with googling whether or not I should be using the create-react-app npm package (I still am), which then led me into more googling on what actually even is Webpack (I’m still trying to find a solid answer to that, besides that it’s a module bundler 🤷🏻‍) and if create-react-app is a copout for learning something important (it might be - but my goal at this point is to learn React, not Webpack).</p>
            <p>I followed the <a class="challenge-link" href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html" target="_blank">tutorial from the official React site</a> and created a simple tic-tac-toe game (or X’s and O’s as we call it in Canada - well my part of Canada at least). This tutorial assumed zero prior knowledge of React (🙌🏼). By doing this tutorial I was able to learn about the syntax and format of React, without doing anything too complicated - I went from having a simple, empty grid, to having a functioning game with turn-taking, a function to declare a winner, and the ability to view the history of each move in the game.                 </p>
            <img class="post-image" src="./images/tictactoe.gif" alt="">
            <p>Very soon after starting this tutorial, I realized that VS Code was not down with letting me use the handy tab-to-autocomplete feature (that takes "div" to "&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" with a simple press of the tab button) with JSX - a cruel case of you don’t really know what you got till it’s gone 💔. But don’t fret! This issue was EASILY solved. Simply click on ‘JavaScript’ in the bottom right corner of VS Code, then choose React in the menu, and then the tab feature is back! 🙌🏼🙌🏼 (Along with many other features I’ve been taking for granted, I’m sure). </p>
            <p>One thing I really liked about this tutorial is that it included opportunities and instructions on how to refactor the code and why it should be done (for example, changing the Square class to a functional component). The tutorial also included some ideas to improve the game if you want to keep practicing *without instructions* - which I've bookmarked for a day when I know a bit more about React (and have more time).</p>
